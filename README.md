## 0. Intro

I am Jake. I'm a pessimist.

## 1. Numbers are super convincing

* Headline: "Poverty dropped from 20% to 18%" is Woah! but accurate? 

* Headline 2: "Poverty might have dropped or gone up" is accurate, but meh.

## 2. ... so treat that power responsibly

* Headline 3: "One in five still below poverty line"

* Use language that expresses confidence, or squishiness of numbers.

* Use round numbers when they are not precise, like with surveys.

## 3. Data is a source: Interrogate it hard enough and it'll tell you anything you want to know

* I.E. FBI Hate Crime data

* https://trendct.org/2016/11/21/connecticut-saw-a-drop-in-reports-of-hate-crime-incidents-in-2015/

* Comey: "We need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop it."

## 4. Sometimes the story is simple:

## 5. Sometimes the data is so complex, you need to make sense of it
