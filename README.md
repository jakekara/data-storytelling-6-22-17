## 0. Intro

I am Jake. I'm a ~~pessimist~~ skeptic.

I do the best I can  with data that already exists.

## 1. Numbers are super convincing

* Headline: "Poverty dropped from 20% to 18%" is Woah! but accurate? What about a +/-2 margin of error?

* Headline 2: "Poverty might have dropped or gone up" is accurate, but meh.

## 2. ... so treat that power responsibly

* Headline 3: "One in five still below poverty line"

* Use language that expresses confidence, or squishiness of numbers.

* Use round numbers when they are not precise, like with surveys.

* Example: "about 560,000" instead of "an estimated 560,042 with a margin of error 580."

## 3. A data set is a source: Interrogate it long enough and it'll tell you anything you want to know

* Sometimes your data don't know the answer to your question

* I.E. election polling on numbers blogs, versus general-audience stories.

* I.E. FBI Hate Crime data. The story that wasn't.

* https://trendct.org/2016/11/21/connecticut-saw-a-drop-in-reports-of-hate-crime-incidents-in-2015/

* Comey: "We need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop it."

# THE VIZ PART

## 5. Sometimes the data is so complex, you need to make sense of it
